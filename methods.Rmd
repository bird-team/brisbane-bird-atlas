# Methods

The Atlas is built around data pulled from [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), an open access citizen science project run by the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](http://www.birds.cornell.edu). The dataset comprises all validated wild bird records from within the Brisbane Local Government Area and any offshore point within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone that has the Brisbane LGA as its closest point on land, as per current eBird protocol. This includes reports of escapees and feral introduced birds, as well as natives and vagrants. The entirety of the survey area is divided up into 4km^2^ squares for distribution mapping purposes; each square has a unique numerical code and land squares have unique names as well.

Data analysis is predominately done in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). The Atlas is built around [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), with additional sections in other languages - see the [GitHub](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas) and [wiki](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#what-is-github) for more details. The _Atlas_ is updated with the latest version of the [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) dataset every few months or so, and is currently based on the `r data_release_month_year` release.
