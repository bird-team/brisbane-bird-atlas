# Preface

**The distribution, abundance and seasonality of Brisbaneâ€™s birds. An open-access resource prepared by the birding community of Brisbane, based on eBird data contributed by hundreds of observers.**

**Please note that this project is still very much under active construction and is not yet ready for contributions.**

This atlas is generously supported by Birds Queensland.
