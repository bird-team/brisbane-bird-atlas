# Gazetteer

Brisbane's birdlife is varied and abundant. All across the region there are sites which host scores of species. This page is intended to showcase some of the very best birding hotspots Brisbane has to offer. Initially, this comprises those [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) hotspots with over 150 recorded species:

**[1. Tinchi Tamba Wetlands Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L960635)**  
236 Species | [27°17'56.9"S 153°02'12.0"E](https://goo.gl/maps/sjWBv5DSmoT2)  
Brisbane's most abundant birding hotspot, the Tinchi Tamba Wetlands are a large expanse of intertidal mudflats and wetlands in the far north of the city. The mudflats provide a high tide roost for dozens of wader species, including rare vagrant shorebirds such as Long-toed Stint and Pectoral Sandpiper. The freshwater lagoons offer a different habitat and consequently have different birds, including on occasion Brolga, Black-Necked Stork, Little Grassbird and Australian Spotted Crake, all rare species within the Brisbane boundary.  
Local Experts: Ged Tranter, Steve Murray, Rick Franks.

**[2. Oxley Creek Common](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L967148)**  
214 Species  |  [27°32'09.2"S 152°59'34.2"E](https://goo.gl/maps/pDD3an4XLg12)  
By far Brisbane's most visited birding location, Oxley Creek Common is a vast expanse of grazing fields, woodland and wetlands nestled between the industrial suburbs of Rocklea, Oxley and Sherwood in the inner south west of the city. As many as 70 species of bird can be found in one hour at the Common, including the odd rarity. Brown Quails are a staple and can be easily found scurrying in large groups along the side of the path - a favourite of many visiting birders.  
Local Experts: Hugh Possingham, Mat Gilfedder.

**[3. Sandy Camp Road Wetlands](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1788977)**  
207 Species | [27°26'05.8"S 153°08'50.4"E](https://goo.gl/maps/kxuEihD44V12)  
Another very popular site within Brisbane, Sandy Camp is a large area of freshwater wetlands in the middle of the industrial centre east of Brisbane. Crakes and Rails are highly sought after here, and can be found early most mornings in the reeds fringing the ponds. Australian Little Bitterns are very secretive but are present at the site over summer, and Black Bitterns are rare visitors and are very difficult to find.  
Local Experts: Chris Attewell, Richard Miller, Andrew Naumann.

**[4. Lake Manchester](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2558202)**  
201 Species | [27°29'23.8"S 152°44'44.0"E](https://goo.gl/maps/RwiU3siiF3p)  
Much less visited than the sites above, Lake Manchester makes up for a lack of popularity with a plethora of birds. Situated on the far west edge of Brisbane out near Ipswich, Lake Manchester provides habitat for many inland birds not found anywhere else in the region. It is one of the best sites in Brisbane for nocturnal birds, with Powerful Owl, Southern Boobook, Australian Owlet-Nightjar, White-throated Nightjar and Barn Owl all being commonly encountered at night. King Quail are a scarce resident among rank grasses fringing the lake and nearby Cabbage Tree Creek, and the site has played host to a large number of rare inland birds, particularly during dry years in the interior.  
Local Experts: Richard Fuller, Ged Tranter, Steve Murray.

**[5. Kedron Brook Wetlands Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1176744)**  
200 Species | [27°24'03.7"S 153°04'45.7"E](https://goo.gl/maps/HDzBGFjrUzv)  
Another fantastic set of wetlands in the coastal region of Brisbane are the Kedron Brook Wetlands, situated by the banks of Kedron Brook at the end of Toombul Rd. Perhaps best known to Brisbane birders as being by far the most reliable site for Australasian Grass-Owls in the city, the wetlands are also home to many other rare and enchanting birds. Shorebirds are common in summer, with Sharp-tailed Sandpipers being the most abundant migratory bird, although rare Brisbane vagrants also turn up. The site is also particularly good for raptors, and notably has recorded Black Falcons on many occasions, as well as most other Brisbane birds of prey.  
Local Experts: Dezmond Wells, Steve Murray, Chris Attewell, Louis Backstrom.

**[6. Gold Creek Reservoir](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L976352)**  
198 Species | [27°27'46.3"S 152°53'00.1"E](https://goo.gl/maps/gAVcZZxZsA42)  
A favourite spot for rainforest birding in Brisbane, Gold Creek Reservoir is a small dam situated in Upper Brookfield that is surrounded by prime lowland rainforest and wet sclerophyll habitat. The site is home to a number of species scarcely found eslewhere in Brisbane, including Crested Shrike-tit, Barred Cuckooshrike (in summer) and even the elusive Black-breasted Buttonquail, although the latter has not been recorded in several years. It is also one of the best locations in Brisbane to find Grey Goshawks, although the birds are quite unreliable.  
Local Experts: Chris Burwell, Jo Culican.

**[7. Dowse Lagoon](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1896576)**  
197 Species | [27°18'57.2"S 153°03'44.1"E](https://goo.gl/maps/koVnv3mKjMv)  
Another prolific wetland hotspot on Brisbane's northside, Dowse Lagoon is a large brackish lake covered in lily pads and home to a large variety of waterbirds. Magpie Geese are common here, and this is the most reliable spot in Brisbane for Cotton Pygmy-Goose, although the species is still rare. Latham's Snipe, Plumed Whistling-Duck and Comb-crested Jacana are also found here regularly, and in the past the site has had Wood Sandpiper, White-winged Black Tern and Eastern Yellow Wagtail turn up as rare vagrants.  
Local Experts: Ged Tranter, Steve Murray, Rick Franks.

**[8. Anstead Bushland Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L974746)**  
195 Species  |  [27°32'35.0"S 152°51'40.1"E](https://goo.gl/maps/MihLcMFoZ2U2)  
A large area of woodland habitat in Brisbane's west, Anstead Bushland Reserve is a site where anything can turn up. Along with hosting a good variety of inland birds not found commonly elsewhere in Brisbane, the hotspot has recorded vagrants such as Red Wattlebird, Red-winged Parrot, Red-rumped Parrot, and Regent Honeyeater.  
Local Experts: Rod Gardner.

**[9. Lytton Wader Roost and Wynnum Mangrove Boardwalk](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1177500)**  
190 Species | [27°25'20.6"S 153°10'03.7"E](https://goo.gl/maps/1LuTrVvQDbn)  
The Lytton Wader Roost is a large claypan near the Wynnum Mudflats that holds large numbers of shorebirds at high tide when they come into roost. The nearby Wynnum Mangrove Boardwalk is a good spot for finding the birds at low tides as they feed out on the mudflats, as well as for mangrove specialist species such as Torresian Kingfisher, Mangrove Gerygone and Mangrove Honeyeater. The roost is an excellent spot for Pied Stilt, Chestnut Teal, Common Greenshank and Grey-tailed Tattler, among other species, and has in the past had vagrants visit including Asian Dowitcher, White-winged Black Tern, Long-toed Stint and Ruff.  
Local Experts: Matteo Grilli.

**[10. Boondall Wetlands Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L921912)**  
189 Species  |  [27°20'25.8"S 153°04'40.8"E](https://goo.gl/maps/jBRzTZogJS32)  
A large area of mangroves and coastal paperbark forest in Brisbane's north east, the Boondall Wetlands have long been protected as an important site for Moreton Bay's migratory birds. While not as intensely birded as some of the other major wetland sites along the coast, Boondall nonetheless has many species of birds that call it home. Migratory shorebirds roost along the banks of mangrove-lined creeks, while common woodland birds call in the trees behind. This is one of the best locations in Brisbane for Shining Flycatcher, but these birds are not easy to find hidden among the mangroves.  
Local Experts: Steve Murray, Rick Franks, Felicia Chan.

**[11. Minnippi Parklands](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1161973)**  
189 Species | [27°28'59.5"S 153°06'53.9"E](https://goo.gl/maps/f7LgSbDY4HT2)  
A productive area of parkland to the south east of the city, Minnippi is a varied area with wetlands, forest and grassy verges and hosts a large variety of species. In the past the site has turned up rare vagrants including Freckled Duck, Spotted Harrier, Sooty Tern (following Cyclone Oswald) and Scaly-breasted Munia.  
Local Experts: Stuart Pickering.

**[12. D'Aigular National Park - Araucaria Circuit](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2177590)**  
180 Species | [27°26'27.7"S 152°55'16.7"E](https://goo.gl/maps/a2Ni6StXqht)  
Enoggera Reservoir, situated to in The Gap in the west of Brisbane, is one of the most varied sites in Brisbane. Araucaria Circuit covers the north east section of the dam, starting and finishing at the Walkabout Creek Discovery Centre. The reservoir is one of the best locations in Brisbane for White-bellied Cuckooshrike, Crested Shrike-tit and Hardhead, with the latter being found in vast numbers across the lake. Rare vagrants or difficult species that have occurred at the site include Regent Honeyeater, Black-breasted Buttonquail, Musk Duck and Dusky Woodswallow.  
Local Experts: Colin Reid, Brad Woodworth, Steve Murray, Lucas Brook.

**[13. Nudgee Beach Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1172123)**  
176 Species  |  [27°20'39.8"S 153°05'53.2"E](https://goo.gl/maps/mcA3bxK56RR2)  
A large area of mudflats on the edge of Moreton Bay to the north east of the city, Nudgee Beach is adjacent to Boondall Wetlands and hosts thousands of migratory shorebirds each year. Bar-tailed Godwits, Curlew Sandpipers, Red-necked Stints and Pacific Golden-Plovers are all common here. Rarer shorebirds have turned up on occasion but nothing of major significance. The site is also excellent for Little Terns in summer, with counts of over 100 recorded.  
Local Experts: Malcolm Graham, Louis Backstrom, Matteo Grilli.

**[14. Prior's Pocket](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2558779)**  
174 Species  |  [27°35'45.9"S 152°53'59.2"E](https://goo.gl/maps/QjrD5spexYx)  
On the upper banks of Brisbane River near the Moggill Ferry crossing is Prior's Pocket, a Brisbane City Council Park that has a rich variety of birdlife. Yellow-rumped Thornbill, Brown and Rufous Songlark, Yellow-billed Spoonbill and various Woodswallow species are all rare Brisbane birds which occur relatively commonly at Prior's Pocket, and even rarer birds such as Freckled Duck, Hoary-headed Grebe, Spotted Harrier, Red-backed Kingfisher and Red-backed Buttonquail have occurred - anything can turn up at Prior's Pocket. Be sure to look up every once in a while too, as raptors are common circling overhead. - Black and Black-shouldered Kites feature commonly.  
Local Experts: Rod Gardner.

**[15. Port of Brisbane Island](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2559161)**  
164 Species  |  [27°22'43.6"S 153°10'29.3"E](https://goo.gl/maps/52R3QPttp2R2)  
The Port of Brisbane, situated on Fisherman Island at the mouth of the Brisbane River, is a bustling port with large amounts of industrial activity, but is somewhat unique among busy ports in that it has numerous areas dedicated to birds and their environment. The Port of Brisbane has a large shorebird roost (encompassed by a [separate eBird hotspot](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L984917)) as well as [several large lakes](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1367805) but the rest of the island also hosts a great variety of species. Access to the island itself is straightforward - the Port of Brisbane Motorway leads right there - but access into the majority of areas in the Port is strictly controlled due to maritime regulations. Contact the [Port Office](https://www.portbris.com.au/) for advice on access to such areas.  
Local Experts: Richard Miller, Rae Clark.

**[16. Shelley Road Park](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L5769634)**  
162 Species  |  [27°29'29.7"S 152°44'35.8"E](https://goo.gl/maps/MSufNbPNDLo)  
Situated an the extreme west edge of Brisbane across the road from Lake Manchester, Shelley Road Park is an area just being discovered by Brisbane's birders. A large area of open woodland, grassy fields and muddy verges of the upper Brisbane River, the site's species list is rapidly incrementing and has turned up numerous rare vagrants including Black Falcon, Red-backed Kingfisher and four species of Woodswallow. One of the best locations in Brisbane for birds of prey, with 13 hawk, 3 owl and 5 falcon species having been recorded, many of which are resident at the site. It may be a long way from the city, but it's worth the drive out to Shelley Road, as anything can turn up on any given day.  
Local Experts: Richard Fuller.

**[17. Fitzgibbon Bushland](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2559485)**  
160 Species | [27°20'07.6"S 153°01'41.2"E](https://goo.gl/maps/dVhaia4LFSG2)  
An area of preserved bushland situated in the modern Fitzgibbon Chase estate, Fitzgibbon Bushland hosts a wide variety of species and has turned up a number of interesting birds over the years. It has been in recent times one of the best locations in Brisbane for Painted Buttonquail, although the birds are still very cryptic and difficult to find. Other local specialties include Little Wattlebird (scarce throughout much of mainland Brisbane), Common Cicadabird and Grey Goshawk. Many species turn up for a short while and then disappear again, so be sure to check back regularly at the site for new birds.  
Local Experts: Ged Tranter, Ross Smith.

**[18. Moggill Wetlands](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L2558803)**  
160 Species  |  [27°35'12.2"S 152°51'37.4"E](https://goo.gl/maps/mbqFHNLizkL2)  
A small area of wetlands near the end of Moggill Road at the Moggill Ferry, this site has much to offer despite its small size. Like other western Brisbane hotspots, numerous inland vagrants have turned up over the years, including Hoary-headed Grebe, Freckled Duck and Red-rumped Parrot. Other good birds turn up more regularly, such as Yellow-billed Spoonbill (rare in Brisbane), White-necked Heron, White-bellied Cuckooshrike and Plumed Whistling-Duck.  
Local Experts: Rod Gardner, Jo Culican.

**[19. Metroplex Wetlands](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L1177484)**  
158 Species  |  [27°27'12.7"S 153°06'03.6"E](https://goo.gl/maps/kzTedgzr66P2)  
Situated just to the west of the Gateway Bridge in Murarrie, Metroplex Wetlands are home to perhaps Brisbane's best-known pair of Peregrine Falcons, which nest high up on the bridge. Aside from the falcons, the site hosts a nice variety of waterbirds and is a real gem nestled within the surrounding industrial centres.  
Local Experts: Chris Attewell, Richard Miller.  

**[20. Sergeant Dan Stiller Memorial Reserve](https://ebird.org/australia/hotspot/L3185687)**  
158 Species | [27°38'38.2"S 153°00'11.3"E](https://goo.gl/maps/JCUfTLggKDJ2)  
Located in the extreme south of Brisbane near the border with Logan, Sergeant Dan Stiller Memorial Reserve is an area visited less than many of the sites above it on this list but nonetheless has a fantastic variety of birdlife. With increased visitation it is sure to turn up some interesting rarities, but already the site has boasted birds such as Cotton Pygmy-Goose, Glossy Black-Cockatoo and Jacky Winter.  
Local Experts: Tim and Marg Roberts.
