Resources Directory
=======

This directory is for storing useful resources to be used when writing the _Atlas_ - e.g. old lists, freely available articles, records etc.
Resources of a sensitive nature (or those which are not available to the public freely) should be kept privately or in a password-protected area. There is an _Atlas_ Dropbox set-up for such purposes.
