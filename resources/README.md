**Resources Directory**

This directory is for storing useful resources to be used when writing the atlas - e.g. old lists, freely available articles, records etc. 
Resources of a sensitive nature (or those which are not available to the public freely) should be kept privately or in a password-protected area. There is an Atlas Dropbox set-up for such purposes.
