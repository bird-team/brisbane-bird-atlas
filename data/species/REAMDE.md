Atlas Species List
==========

The file in this directory contains the master list for the species in the Atlas and several associated parameters. 
For information on changing the species in this list, ie after an eBird taxonomy update, please see the relevant FAQ on the GitHub.

The key for species categories is loosely based on the BOU classification (https://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/) and is as follows:

A: A species that has occurred naturally in a wild state ever, regardless of date
B: Redundant & unused
C: Naturalised / introduced
D: A species that likely only occurred as an escapee, but could in theory turn up wild
E: Definite escapee
F: Fossil records or records pre-1800 
X: Category pending
