Atlas Species List
==========

The file in this directory contains the master list for the species in the _Atlas_ and several associated parameters.
For information on changing the species in this list, i.e. after an eBird taxonomy update, please see the relevant FAQ on the GitHub.

# Categories

The key for species categories is loosely based on the BOU classification (https://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/) and is as follows:

A: A species that has occurred naturally in a wild state ever, regardless of date
B: Redundant & unused
C: Naturalised / introduced
D: A species that likely only occurred as an escapee, but could in theory turn up wild
E: Definite escapee
F: Fossil records or records pre-1800
G: Domestic types, regardless of wild/escapee status
H: Hybrids
X/Pending: Category pending

# Working List

This spreadsheet is designed to complement the Working List, which contains more detail on the status of each species within Brisbane. Any changes made in one list should be reflected in the other, if possible. The Working List can be located within the `/resources` folder.
