Vegetation Data
==========

This directory contains the vegetation data used to produce graphs in the _Atlas_. Specifically, it contains a modified version of the vegetation data "Remnant 2015 broad vegetation groups - Queensland". This modified version was produced by clipping the raw vegetation data to the study area (buffered by 20 km), dissolving the vegetation data by the DBVG5 field, and renaming the classes according to their names in the spreadsheet (i.e. "L&W_Adudit" column).
