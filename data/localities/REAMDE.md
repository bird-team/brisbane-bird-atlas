Locality Exclusions
==========

The file in this folder can be modified to exclude certain eBird locations from the Atlas, i.e. those which are too broad to be useful or incorrectly located. 
This should be used sparingly and as a last resort - it is better to fix the data itself, where possible, rather than simply exclude it completely.
