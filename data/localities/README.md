Locality Exclusions
==========

The file in this folder can be modified to exclude certain eBird locations from the _Atlas_, i.e. those which are too broad to be useful or incorrectly located.
This should be used sparingly and as a last resort - it is better to fix the data itself, where possible, rather than simply exclude it completely. If you believe that the location of a record has been poorly attributed, please contact one of the _Atlas_ editors, or an eBird moderator.
