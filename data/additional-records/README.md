Additional Records
==========

This file is used for additional records not otherwise in the eBird dataset (for whatever reason). Ideally it will be kept short; records should be entered into eBird if at all possible. For large datasets complementary to the main eBird dataset, if these are unable to be imported into eBird they should be treated separately to this dataset and put in their own subfolder in the `/data` directory.
