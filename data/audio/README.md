Audio File
==========

The file in this directory contains the data associated with audio recordings of calls for each species. It can be edited to add one or more recordings of each species' call.
Preference is for high-quality, public domain calls from as close to Brisbane as possible. 
Where the recording is not in the public domain / under creative commons licensing, permission must be given by the author for use in the Atlas.
