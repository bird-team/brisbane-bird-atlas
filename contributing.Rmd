# Contributing

The _Atlas_ project is still very much under active construction and is not yet ready for public contributions. Please check the [index page](https://brisbanebirds.com/index.html) for exciting updates and ways to help the atlas. In the meantime, go out and bird! Any records you enter into [eBird](https://ebird.org/australia/subnational2/AU-QLD-BRI) from within the Brisbane Local Government Area will make their way into this project. If you would like to help the atlas grow, you can visit the GitHub page for the project to write some text - see [here](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#how-can-i-contribute-to-this-atlas). The Github repository and associated wiki have plenty of information on how to contribute text or back-end changes. If you would like further clarification or assistance, feel free to contact one of the _Atlas_ administrators or [create an issue on the repository](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas/issues/new/choose).

The Atlas of Brisbane Birds uses data pulled from [eBird](https://ebird.org/home). If you would like to have your records be added to the _Atlas_ all you need to do is ensure that they are entered into eBird - the rest is done automatically. Check out [how to make the most of your eBird checklists](https://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/974012) to ensure the data going into the Atlas - and any other eBird-dependent projects - are as good as possible. Currently, the atlas lacks a lot of data for the breeding activity of most species - so if you see any breeding behaviour in the birds you report, please add it in using the [eBird breeding codes](https://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/1006850-breeding-codes-behavior-codes)!

The _Atlas_ project endorses ethical birding. The welfare of our birds is the highest priority so please engage in birding practices which do not adversely impact the birds around you. Nesting and migratory birds are particularly vulnerable to disturbances.

**Future Update Goals**

- Complete species accounts for all recorded Brisbane bird species
- Grid square survey sheets for every cell
- More comprehensive data for all species, particularly poorly known ones e.g. seabirds and breeding information
