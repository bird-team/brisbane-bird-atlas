# Contributing

The _Atlas_ project is still very much under active construction and is not yet ready for public contributions. Please check the [index page](https://brisbanebirds.com/index.html) for exciting updates and ways to help the atlas. In the meantime, go out and bird! If you would like to help the atlas grow, you can visit the GitHub page for the project to write some text as well - see [here](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions#how-can-i-contribute-to-this-atlas).

**Future Update Goals**

- Complete species accounts for all recorded Brisbane bird species
- Grid square survey sheets for every cell
- More comprehensive data for all species, particularly poorly known ones e.g. seabirds
