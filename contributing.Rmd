# Contributing

The Atlas project is still very much under active construction and is not yet ready for public contributions. Please check back in the future for exciting updates and ways to help the atlas. In the meantime, go out and bird!

**Future Update Goals**
- Complete species accounts for all recorded Brisbane bird species
- Grid square survey sheets for every cell
- More comprehensive data for all species, particularly poorly known ones e.g. seabirds
