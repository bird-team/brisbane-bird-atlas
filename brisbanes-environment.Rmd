# Brisbane's Environment

The Brisbane Local Government Area (LGA) is home to many varied habitat types. Dominated by the urban footprint of Brisbane City and surrounding suburbs, the majority of land in the LGA is non-remnant habitat covered by houses, infrastructure and provides limited opportunity for most wildlife to thrive. It is in the cities many parks, both natural and man-made, that birdlife abounds.

The coastline of Moreton Bay to the east of the city is dominated by estuarine mangrove forests and mudflats, which play host to 50,000 migratory shorebirds each year, as well as providing much-needed habitat for several other cryptic species within the city. Sites such as Tinchi Tamba Wetlands, Kedron Brook Wetlands and Sandy Camp Road all cater to a significant variety of bird species; each of these three sites have over 200 recorded species.

To the north west of the city, the foothills of the D'Aigular Range slope steadily up towards Mount Nebo and Mount Glorious, and are home to the majority of the area's subtropical rainforest. Slightly further south, the Taylor Range and its peak, Mt Coot-tha, is covered in mixed sclerophyll habitat. Together, these two ranges combine to form a vast area of prime forest habitat that for the most part is poorly covered by birders.

Moving further south, the extreme south west of the region is mostly flat, and is dominated by sparse semi-rural farmland with pockets of remnant habitat. Dry eucalpyt forest covers the western border with Somerset Regional Council near Lake Manchester, while grassy scrub accounts for much of the remaining ground cover. This is an area of Brisbane rarely visited by birders and locals alike, despite sites such as Moggil Conservation Park and Lake Manchester being some of the richest birdlife hotspots in South East Queensland.

The majority of the south and south east section of Brisbane City Council is non-remnant housing, with only restricted pockets of bushland and consequently limited variety of birdlife. Bushland reserves in Toohey Forest, Whites Hill and Belmont make up the greatest part of green space, although there are numerous smaller parks and reserves which provide limited habitat for some bird species. Despite this area containing some of the most densely populated suburbs in Brisbane, on the whole it lacks birding coverage, in part due to the paucity of large sites and in part due to preference for well-establish birding hotspots in other areas of the city.

Finally, across Moreton Bay lies Moreton Island, a 186kmÂ² sand island that shelters the bay from the worst of the Coral Sea's weather and provides habitat for many species of bird that are absent or vanishingly rare on the mainland. The north end of the island is predominately heath, a habitat not found on the mainland, while the south is coastal scrub and dry eucalpyt forest. Together with the extensive sandy coastline that surrounds nearly the entire island, there is habitat for nearly 150 species of birds. This number would no doubt be higher with increased birding activity and detection, but due to access difficulty, Moreton Island remains undoubtedly the least birded region within Brisbane City Council.

Together, the entire City of Brisbane has recorded close to 400 species of birds, with several new species added each year. With increased activity around the edges of the LGA, particularly in areas such as Lake Manchester and Moreton Island, this number is sure to increment steadily upwards, highlighting just how fantastic a biodiversity hotspot our city is.
